Audible YouTube Mobile (AYM) is a music player that allows you to stream and download music for free without interruption.

The key features are:

1. Minimal
    
    Aimed at simplicity and objectivity; no gimmicks or unnecessary input controls or navigational components. Suitable for users who only want to listen to their music library and perhaps separate them into playlists and nothing else.

2. Lightweight

    AYM is decoupled from its backend capabilities. It relies on backend services for the majority of its features, therefore its small memory footprint and CPU usage.
